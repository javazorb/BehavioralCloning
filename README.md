# BehavioralCloning

## Work in Progress
**TODO:**
+ add setup method
+ Debug and review TODOs inside of code
+ add more metrics outside of report
+ tidy up everything
+ add code for extensive testing the generalization of models

## Description
This Project explores the generalization capabilities of an Convolutional Neural Network making use of Behavioral Cloning versus a Deep Q-Network(DQN) on unseen Environments modelled after the Jumping Task environments.
    Behavioral Cloning is a Reinforcement Learning Method used to train an agent to mimic the actions of an expert. Additionally, it provides an outlook on improving generalization using advanced models like Deep Q-Networks. Furthermore, an assessment criteria will be, the performance of these models versus their taken training time to achieve maximum performance on the test set. After determining the best performing models, their generalization abilities will be tested on various different generated environments. These will include environments generated with more than one obstacle which are differently spaced out. From narrow- to wide- and random spaced obstacles. Finally, an outlook for future possibilities of this project will be provided.
